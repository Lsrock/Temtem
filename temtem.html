<h1>Top five dark souls bosses that will make you quit the game</h1>

<p>As told by Jonny, who spoke faster than I could type, and written by Lucy.</p>

<h2><a name="Gael">Slave Knight Gael - Dark Souls III</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Slave+Knight+Gael+(Boss)"> Slave Knight Gale</a>. The coolest. He made the top of the list because he is the last boss of all bosses. He is the last
  boss of all souls games. A huge call back to the inspiration of dark souls itself, Berserk. He embodies every boss
  fight, like everything you've learned is put to the test when you fight him. From a giant arena, to homing AOEs, to
  his giant sword swings, to his automatic crossbow, to even his amazing soundtrack that plays when you fight him.
  Aesthetically the coolest, and one of the hardest fights in Dark Souls.</p>

<h2><a name="Friede">Sister Friede - Dark Souls III</a></h2>

<p>Do you even know who <a href="https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Sister+Friede">SHE</a> is? Shes fucking amazing. She has a ornstein and smough vibes, sister frieda definitely
  deserves the number two spot. Alright, let me tell ya. She's a two part battle, with number one giving a boss battle
  of omages. An homage to pricilla, she fights similarly . Shes just really fucking cool, with her settings, her ties to
  the lore, shes asthectiacally pleasing, and a great gatekeeper. She's timid and
  cautious in part 1, and then assertive in part two.</p>

<h2><a name="Astraea">Maiden Astraea - Demon Souls</a></h2>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/demonssouls/images/e/e8/Maiden_Astraea_render.png/revision/latest?cb=20130629050116" width="300px" alt=""/>
<p><a href="https://demonssouls.fandom.com/wiki/Maiden_Astraea"> Her</a> fight is really cool because you have to go through this super frustrating level, that just builds up your
  frustration that you want are just waiting to unleash on the boss. But when you finally get to her you realize that
  you don't actually want to fight her, because you learn she's just a maiden that wants to do good. But you have to
  kill her for the sake of the story. Like during the fight, she pleads and begs you to leave her alone so she can
  continue to save people. She doesn’t even fight you, her <a href="https://demonssouls.fandom.com/wiki/Garl_Vinland">guard</a> does. Even when you kill him, she still doesn’t put up
  a fight. It’s like bullying someone. And the somber sad song that plays during her fight, is a reminder that even
  though you are the main character, you may not always be the good guy. And that's what makes her a really cool boss
  battle.</p>

<h2><a name="My left hand guy">Artorias - Dark souls II</a></h2>
<img src="https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Dark-Souls/artorias_header_full.jpg?v=1529081239468" width="800px" alt=""/>
<p>Lets do my boy some justice. Hes really fucking cool. Alright here it is, my mans, are you ready? <a href="https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Artorias+the+Abysswalker">Artorias</a> of the
  abyss is a really cool boss battle, because throughout the game you always hear about him. But when you finally
  encounter him, you come across this noble night that failed to the abyss. It’s just a cool thing to see that the
  legend you keep hearing about isn't about him, but it's about you. You get to see like the reality that these great
  heroes don’t always win. Like a slap of reality. Plus he has a <a href="https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Great+Grey+Wolf+Sif">dog</a>, that he used his shield to protect him when he was
  defeated by the abyss and broke his arm. Even after you kill artorias you still see remnants of his actions and his
  legacy in the future. You get the feeling that he's passing the torch on to you. And canonically hes left handed and
  anyone who says differently are fucking chodes.</p>

<h2><a name="Darth Vader">The Burnt Ivory King - Dark Souls II</a></h2>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/darksouls/images/4/48/SotFS_IvoryKing.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150501011658" width="600px" alt=""/>
<p>The <a href="https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Burnt+Ivory+King">burnt ivory king</a> is actually a really cool fight because throughout the DLC you can free these knights that help
  you though the battle. Its in like a snowy area and you fight in a fire area, and with the help you the knights that
  you freed you fight off corrupted knights until he comes out. And its like a war, until its a 1v2 against this guy
  with a lightsaber and its this really cool climatic battle with a huge fire polel in the background and opera
  music.</p>
